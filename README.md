# Hei, I’m Jinan

When I was young, I spent a lot of time with screens —  
Games, TV, small devices.

I was always curious. I wanted to know how things worked.

As I grew older, that curiosity stayed.  
I began to see patterns, logic, and rules behind everything.

Then I found programming.  
It felt like something I had been searching for.

I slowly fell in love with code —  
with solving problems,  
with understanding systems and technology.

What once felt like magic turned out to be logic.

Life feels like a mountain I started climbing from nothing.

The mountain is high. Every time I try to climb, I fall.  
Rain makes the rocks slippery. The path is rough. Fear stands in my way.

Sometimes I can’t move forward. Sometimes I slide all the way down.  
But I remember this — I chose to climb.

Even if I fall a thousand times, even if I fall a million times,  
I will return to the same mountain.

As long as I can breathe, I will keep climbing.  
As long as I am alive, there is always another chance to reach the top.

If I fall after giving everything I have, that fall is not defeat.

I don’t quit. I don’t surrender.  
I will either reach the peak, or die climbing toward it.
