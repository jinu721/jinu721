# Hei, I’m Jinan

When I was young, I spent a lot of time with screens.  
Games, TV, small devices.

I wondered how they worked.

As I grew up, that curiosity stayed.  
I began to notice patterns, logic, and rules behind things.

When I found programming,  
Like something I was already looking for.

I slowly fell in love with code,  
with solving problems,  
with understanding systems and technology.

What once felt like magic  
proved to be logic.
