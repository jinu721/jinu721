# Hei, I’m Jinan 
When I was a kid, I spent a lot of time with screens.

Games, TV, small devices — I didn’t just use them.  
I watched them closely.

Sometimes I turned the TV around, seriously thinking  
there might be someone inside,  
pressing buttons, making everything move.

That thought stayed with me longer than I expected.

As I grew up, the fantasy slowly faded,  
but the curiosity didn’t.

I started noticing patterns.  
Rules under the surface.  
Logic deciding what was allowed to happen and what wasn’t.

When I first touched code,  
it felt strange in a familiar way.

Like discovering that the thing I imagined as a child  
actually existed —  
just not as a person behind the screen.

It was systems.  
Logic.  
Technology.

That’s probably when it happened —  
I fell in love with that old feeling again.  
The same magic I felt as a kid,  
now real, explainable, and buildable.

I write code to stay close to that feeling.  
To build things instead of wondering how they work.  
To be on the other side of the screen.
